Brief Description: This game is called Pinball, a take on a classic arcade game. The programme takes advantage of
the main principles covered in Pong analysed in class. The purpose of the game is to score maximum points. 
At the start Player is asked to enter player name and choose the width of the Flipper( the smaller the Flipper the 
higher the scores).Player has 5 lives per game and 3 games per tournament before the highest score is displayed
and the game is over. 
Pinball comes out from the shoot on the left hand side, it bounces off various obstacles (circles, bumpers, launch shoot)
as well as both sides and top. Player has control of the position of the Flipper by moving the mouse. As Pinball bounces 
around, accumulating points, level of the game (1, 2 or 3: determined by the Flipper size) and player's name are displayed 
on screen throughout the game. Pinball also gains speed as it hits various objects, collision sounds play, background flashes.
As the Player finishes each game, a message is displayed giving lives lost, level played and games left as well as an 
option to continue to the next game or quit early. As all games are played the highest score is displayed and the game is
over.


Known bugs/problems: as the Pinball eccelerates sometimes it gets stuck between the obstacles. Once in a while the background 
doesn't flash on collision and occasionally the bounce off the launch shoot appears to be off the middle of it as apposed 
to its sides and top. Also, the game is more bouncing balls for you, Colm, sorry. At least there is no moon or 
sun in this one. Some lack of imagination and, certainly, skills is to blame here.
